Computer Systems Coursework, Part2
1. A file server receives requests via a network. It takes 20 ms to dispatch the
requested data and do the necessary processing, assuming that the data
needed are in the cache. If a disk operation is needed, as is the case in
one third of the time, an additional 90 ms is required, during which time
the thread sleeps.
(a) How many request/sec can the server handle if it is single threaded?
[10 marks]

A request requiring a disk operation will take 20ms + 90ms = 110ms

The weighted average is:

	= (2/3)*20ms + (1/3)*110ms
	= 50ms (per request)
	
Thus requests per second is:

	= 1/0.05
	= 20 requests per sec
	
(b) If it is multithreaded (one thread popping up at each request)?

For a multithreaded server, all the waiting for the disk is overlapped, so every request takes 20ms, and the server can handle 50 requests per second.


2. Five jobs A through E arrive at a multiprogrammed computer center at
almost the same time. They have estimated running times of 10, 6, 2, 4
and 8 minutes, respectively. Their fixed priorities are 3, 5, 2, 1, and 4,
respectively. For each of the following scheduling algorithms, determine
the average turnaround time.
(a) Round robin (choose a realistic quantum that would allow a short
response time for potential user requests).
[5 marks]
(b) Priority scheduling (5 being the highest priority).
[4 marks]
(c) First-come-first-served (in order A, . . . , E).
[3 marks]
(d) Shortest process next.
[3 marks]
You can ignore process switching overhead and assume that all jobs are
completely CPU-bound.

3. Consider the following variant of the dining philosophers problem. Sup-
pose that there are two types of philosophers. A \righty" always picks up
his right fork first:

begin
	repeat
		think;
		wait ( fork[ (i+1) mod 5] );
		wait ( fork[i] );
		eat;
		signal ( fork[i] );
		signal ( fork[ (i+1) mod 5] );
	forever
end;

while a \lefty" always picks up his left fork first:

begin
	repeat
		think;
		wait ( fork[i] );
		wait ( fork[ (i+1) mod 5] );
		eat;
		signal ( fork[ (i+1) mod 5] );
		signal ( fork[i] );
	forever
end;

Assume that there is at least one righty and one lefty at the round table
and that the scheduling is fair. Determine whether
(a) deadlock
[12 marks]
(b) starvation
[8 marks]
are possible. [Hint: First find out whether a philosopher can pick up at
least one fork.]

4. A UNIX file system has 2-KB blocks and 4-byte disk addresses. What is
the maximum file size if i-nodes contain 10 direct entries, and one single,
double, and triple indirect entry each. (The blocksize of the data blocks
referenced by the i-node is the same as the file system blocksize.)
